## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Thin, light grey text can look sleek and trendy, but there’s a risk that some may find it difficult to read.
- Icons without labels can look clean and minimal, but there’s a risk that some might not understand what the icons mean. This risk is greater for those with cognitive and vision impairments.
- It might look nice to add color to heading text, but there’s a risk that some could mistake it for a link.
