      <em>Hello everyone</em> 😊,
      <br>
      <br>
      Welcome to my piano YouTube playlist! I've been playing the piano for several months now, and I thoroughly enjoy sharing my favorite pieces of music with others. 🤗 This playlist showcases songs from the <abbr title="Méthod Rose in French / Phương pháp hoa hồng in Vietnamese">Methode Rose</abbr> book, all of which I performed. 🎹
      
      <br>
      I hope you'll be able to find something that catches your interest in this playlist. Additionally, I've included <em>a scanned PDF and audio files</em></a> 📃🔊 that could help you enhance your piano skills. The source is found on the internet, although the book is in Vietnamese, it's easy to understand. 😉<br>
      <br>
