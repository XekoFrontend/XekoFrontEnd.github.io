      In CSS, both `background` and `background-image` properties can be used to
      set a background image or a combination of background styles, including
      gradients. However, they serve different purposes and offer different
      levels of control over the background presentation. 1. `background-image`:
      The `background-image` property is specifically used to set a single
      background image to an element. This property is well-suited for cases
      where you want to use an image as the background and do not need
      additional background styles like gradients or colors. Here's an example
      of using `background-image` with a linear gradient: ```css .element {
      background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #ff0000, #00ff00); } ``` In
      this example, the background image will be a linear gradient from red
      (`#ff0000`) at the top to green (`#00ff00`) at the bottom. The
      `background-image` property can also take other types of image sources,
      like URLs pointing to image files. 2. `background`: The `background`
      property is a shorthand property that allows you to apply multiple
      background-related styles at once. It can include not only a background
      image but also other background properties like color, gradient, position,
      repeat, and attachment. Here's an example using `background` with a linear
      gradient: ```css .element { background: linear-gradient(to bottom,
      #ff0000, #00ff00); } ``` The above code is equivalent to setting just the
      `background-image`, but with `background`, you have the flexibility to
      include additional background-related styles if needed: ```css .element {
      background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #ff0000, #00ff00) center/cover
      no-repeat fixed; } ``` In this example, the linear gradient will be
      centered, covering the element without repeating, and will remain fixed
      while scrolling the page. In summary, the main difference between
      `background` and `background-image` is that `background` is a shorthand
      property that allows you to set multiple background styles at once,
      including gradients, colors, image sources, positions, repeat, and
      attachment. On the other hand, `background-image` is specifically used to
      set a single background image or gradient. If you only need to apply a
      gradient, you can use either property, but if you need more
      background-related styles, `background` provides a more comprehensive
      solution.
